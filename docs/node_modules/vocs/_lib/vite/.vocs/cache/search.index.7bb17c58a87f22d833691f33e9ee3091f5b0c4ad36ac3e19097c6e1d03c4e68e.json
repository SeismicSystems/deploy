"{\"value\":{\"mdx\":\"# Seismic Network Custody & Institutional Integration Guide\\n\\nThis document provides information for institutional investors, custodians, and partners looking to integrate Seismic Network. It covers technical custody requirements, participation mechanisms, tokenomics, and regulatory considerations.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Technical Custody Integration](#technical-custody-integration)\\n- [Network Participation](#network-participation)\\n- [Tokenomics & Supply](#tokenomics--supply)\\n- [Regulatory & Compliance](#regulatory--compliance)\\n- [Institutional Support](#institutional-support)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical Custody Integration\\n\\n### How does Seismic differ from standard EVM chains?\\n\\nSeismic is approximately a **superset of the EVM**, meaning:\\n- Standard EVM functionality works identically to Ethereum\\n- Additional features enable shielded (private) computation\\n- Transaction construction and serialization identical to Ethereum (with one new transaction type)\\n- Address generation, gas estimation, and signing work the same as Ethereum\\n\\n**Key differentiating features:**\\n- **Shielded state storage**: Solidity contracts can store private data on-chain\\n- **Encrypted calldata**: New transaction type (0x4a) encrypts transaction calldata\\n- **Privacy-preserving**: Uses Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environments), not zero-knowledge proofs\\n\\n### Which existing EVM chain is Seismic most like?\\n\\nSeismic is most like **Ethereum mainnet** with privacy enhancements. It uses:\\n- Same transaction types (Legacy 0x0 and EIP-1559 0x2) plus one new type (0x4a)\\n- Same gas model (EIP-1559 dynamic fees)\\n- Same serialization (RLP)\\n- Same address generation and cryptographic algorithms (Keccak-256, ECDSA secp256k1)\\n- Same account model (not UTXO-based)\\n\\n### Have any RPC API methods been altered?\\n\\nYes, but only to protect shielded state:\\n- **`eth_getStorageAt`**: Will not reveal shielded storage slots\\n- **Call tracers**: Modified to prevent leaking shielded state in debug traces\\n- **`trace_filter`**: Some specific restrictions (TBD)\\n\\nAll other standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods work identically.\\n\\n### Is transaction construction identical to Ethereum?\\n\\n**Yes**, with one addition:\\n- **Legacy (0x0)** and **EIP-1559 (0x2)** transactions are 100% identical to Ethereum\\n- **Seismic transaction (0x4a)** is essentially a legacy transaction with encrypted calldata\\n\\nStandard Ethereum transaction construction libraries will work without modification.\\n\\n### Can gas be estimated using eth_estimateGas?\\n\\nYes, `eth_estimateGas` works exactly as on Ethereum.\\n\\n### Are there other transaction types that could cause balance changes?\\n\\nThe Seismic transaction type (0x4a) can cause balance changes, but it functions similarly to a standard transaction - it just has encrypted calldata. There are no special transaction types like Arbitrum's Retryable Tickets.\\n\\n### Do ERC-20 transfers emit the standard Transfer event?\\n\\n**It depends on the token type:**\\n\\n- **ERC20 tokens**: Yes, standard ERC20s emit the standard `Transfer` event (topic hash: `0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef`)\\n- **SRC20 tokens** (Seismic's shielded token standard): May not emit the standard Transfer event due to privacy features\\n\\n**Important for custody providers**: SRC20 tokens are expected to dominate on Seismic. Balance tracking may require alternative methods beyond event indexing.\\n\\n### Is the native asset transferred by setting the value field?\\n\\n**Long-term**: Yes, native asset transfers work by setting the `value` field in transactions, identical to Ethereum.\\n\\n**Short-term**: This is still being finalized for early mainnet. The native asset model may evolve in the first months post-launch.\\n\\n### Do you support Anvil for local testing?\\n\\nYou must use **Sanvil**, Seismic's fork of Anvil. Standard Anvil does not support:\\n- Seismic transaction type (0x4a)\\n- Shielded storage opcodes (CLOAD/CSTORE)\\n- Encrypted calldata handling\\n\\nSanvil supports all standard Anvil operations including:\\n- Starting from a fork point or genesis file\\n- Sending native assets and ERC-20 tokens\\n- Contract deployment and testing\\n- Transaction tracing with `debug_traceTransaction`\\n\\n### Are smart contracts verified on Sourcify or Etherscan?\\n\\nContract verification infrastructure is still being finalized. Details will be announced closer to mainnet launch.\\n\\n### What is the expected throughput?\\n\\nSeismic targets:\\n- **Block time**: 600ms - 1 second\\n- **Finality**: 1-2 blocks (< 2 seconds total)\\n- **Stress test results**: Sustained 1000+ QPS with P99 latency in seconds, P50 in tens of milliseconds\\n\\nExact throughput will depend on transaction complexity and network conditions.\\n\\n### Are there deviations in address generation, gas estimation, or transaction signing?\\n\\n**No deviations**. Seismic uses identical mechanisms to Ethereum:\\n- **Address generation**: Hash public key using Keccak-256, take last 20 bytes\\n- **Cryptographic algorithm**: ECDSA with secp256k1 curve\\n- **Serialization**: RLP (Recursive Length Prefix)\\n- **Hashing**: Keccak-256 (SHA-3 variant)\\n- **Replay protection**: EIP-155 chain ID-based nonce system\\n- **Transaction signing**: Standard Ethereum signing with chain ID 5123 (mainnet) or 5124 (testnet)\\n\\n### Can a transaction be signed today and broadcast tomorrow?\\n\\nYes, there is no upper bound on the time between transaction construction and broadcast. Standard Ethereum nonce-based ordering applies.\\n\\n### Does the protocol have gas?\\n\\nYes, Seismic uses the standard Ethereum gas model:\\n- Gas is estimated with `eth_estimateGas`\\n- Excess gas is refunded after execution\\n- Gas must be paid in the native Seismic token (cannot be paid in other currencies)\\n- EIP-1559 dynamic fees apply (base fee + priority fee)\\n\\n### How are accounts created?\\n\\nAccounts are **implicit** (same as Ethereum):\\n- Addresses exist as soon as you have a private key\\n- No on-chain instantiation required\\n- Accounts become \\\"active\\\" when they first receive a transaction or balance\\n\\n### Does the blockchain have anonymity or privacy features?\\n\\nYes, but they are **opt-in**:\\n- Contracts can use shielded storage (CLOAD/CSTORE opcodes) for private state\\n- Users can send Seismic transactions (type 0x4a) with encrypted calldata\\n- Standard transactions remain fully transparent like Ethereum\\n\\nPrivacy is achieved through Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environments), not zero-knowledge proofs.\\n\\n### Can balances change without a corresponding blockchain transaction?\\n\\n**For standard ERC20/ERC721 tokens**: No, all balance changes require on-chain transactions.\\n\\n**For SRC20 (shielded) tokens**: Balance changes are recorded on-chain, but may not be publicly visible in the same way as standard tokens due to privacy features.\\n\\n### Can assets leave an address with no action from the sole key holder?\\n\\nNo, Seismic follows standard Ethereum security model - assets can only move with a valid signature from the private key holder (or via approved smart contract logic like allowances).\\n\\n### Is it possible to query a blockchain node for deposits to an address?\\n\\nYes:\\n- Standard Ethereum methods (`eth_getLogs`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`) work identically\\n- Use RPC filters for event-based indexing\\n- Full archive nodes support querying from genesis\\n\\n**Note**: Shielded (SRC20) token balances may require specialized queries depending on the token implementation.\\n\\n### Is it possible to query the status of a broadcast transaction?\\n\\nYes, use standard Ethereum methods:\\n- `eth_getTransactionReceipt` for finalized transactions\\n- `eth_getTransactionByHash` for pending/confirmed transactions\\n- `eth_blockNumber` to check sync status\\n\\n### How fast does storage for an RPC node grow?\\n\\n- **Current size**: TBD (network launching soon)\\n- **Archive node**: 1TB+ storage recommended initially\\n- **Growth rate**: Will depend on network activity; approximately 12 hours of sync time expected for first year of operation\\n\\nDetailed storage projections will be published after mainnet launch.\\n\\n### How is throughput handled?\\n\\nSeismic is a **monolithic L1 chain** (not sharded). Throughput is handled through:\\n- Fast block times (600ms - 1s)\\n- EIP-1559 dynamic gas pricing\\n- Efficient execution via Reth and seismic-reVM\\n\\n### Is it possible to run a full node in local mode?\\n\\nYes, use **Sanvil** (Seismic's fork of Anvil) for local development and testing, similar to Bitcoin Regtest or Ethereum's Ganache.\\n\\n### Are there any \\\"gotcha's\\\" to be aware of?\\n\\n- **SRC20 tokens**: May not emit standard Transfer events; requires specialized indexing\\n- **Shielded storage**: `eth_getStorageAt` won't reveal private contract state\\n- **Intel TDX requirement**: Nodes require Intel TDX hardware; cannot run on standard VMs\\n- **Sanvil required**: Must use Sanvil instead of Anvil for local testing\\n- **Transaction type 0x4a**: Ensures encrypted calldata is handled correctly\\n- **Block timestamps**: Available in millisecond precision (though `block.timestamp` returns seconds for compatibility)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Network Participation\\n\\n### Does Seismic support staking?\\n\\n**Current status**: Information about staking, delegation, and validation is not yet finalized.\\n\\n**What we know**:\\n- Nodes can publish transactions if properly staked\\n- Staking mechanisms and rewards are still being designed\\n- Updates will be communicated via official channels\\n\\n### Does Seismic support governance?\\n\\n**Current status**: Governance mechanisms have not been publicly specified yet.\\n\\nGovernance details (voting mechanisms, parameter changes, proposals) will be announced as the network matures.\\n\\n### What actions will institutional holders be expected to take upon network launch?\\n\\n**At launch**, institutions should be prepared for:\\n- **Transfers**: Sending and receiving the native token\\n- **Contract interactions**: Deploying and interacting with smart contracts\\n- **Token holdings**: Custody of native assets and potentially SRC20 tokens\\n\\n**Future participation** may include:\\n- Staking and delegation (mechanisms TBD)\\n- Governance voting (mechanisms TBD)\\n- Validator operations (requirements TBD)\\n\\n### Do you have vesting schedules?\\n\\n**Status**: Vesting schedule details have not been publicly disclosed. Please contact the Seismic team directly for information about:\\n- Vesting start/end dates and unlock frequency\\n- On-chain vs off-chain vesting implementation\\n- Whether locked tokens can be used for staking or governance\\n- Whether vested tokens need to be claimed or are automatically distributed\\n\\n### Where can I find tokenomics information?\\n\\nDetailed tokenomics (total supply, supply breakdown, allocation to foundation/grants/investors) have not been publicly released yet.\\n\\nFor institutional inquiries about tokenomics, please contact: **c@seismic.systems**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tokenomics & Supply\\n\\n### What is the total token supply?\\n\\n**Status**: Total supply and distribution details will be announced closer to token generation event (TGE).\\n\\n### What is the fully diluted value (FDV)?\\n\\n**Status**: FDV and institutional ownership percentages will be disclosed closer to TGE.\\n\\n### Who are the current institutional investors?\\n\\n**Status**: Investor information has not been publicly disclosed.
