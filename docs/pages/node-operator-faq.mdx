# Node Operator FAQ

Welcome to the Seismic Network Node Operator FAQ. This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about running and operating nodes on the Seismic Network.

## RPC Operations

### Are there rate limits on RPC calls?

No rate limits are currently imposed by the protocol itself, though node operators may implement their own.

### What are the RPC configuration parameters?

Key Reth parameters include:
- `--rpc.txfeecap`: Maximum transaction fee cap (default: 1 ETH)
- `--rpc.max-response-size`: Maximum response size (default: 160MB, which is very high)

### What is the maximum size for `eth_getLogs` responses?

At least 15MB, with Reth's default configured at 160MB. This can be adjusted if needed.

### Is there a limit on batch RPC requests?

No specific batch count limit - only limited by total payload size. Batch sizes can be arbitrarily large.

### Does Seismic support log lookback?

Yes, full nodes support complete log lookback and retrieval of contract events from the beginning of the chain.

### What sync mode should I use for fetching logs?

Use RPC calls with block filters. Reth may support more efficient methods as well.

### Are block height indicators available?

Yes, use `eth_blockNumber` to check current block height and sync progress. This is also the recommended method to verify node health and sync status.

### What are the heaviest RPC methods?

The most resource-intensive RPC methods are:
- **`eth_getLogs`** with large block ranges or many matching events
- **Tracing calls** (e.g., `debug_traceTransaction`, `trace_*` methods) with complex Geth tracers

These methods typically require more computational resources and may take longer to respond depending on the complexity of the query.

### Are there recommended caching rules for RPC methods?

Caching strategies have not been formally specified yet. Node operators may implement their own caching strategies based on their infrastructure requirements.

## Storage & Performance

### How fast does storage for an RPC node grow?

- **Current size**: TBD (network launching soon)
- **Archive node**: 1TB+ storage recommended initially
- **Growth rate**: Will depend on network activity; approximately 12 hours of sync time expected for first year of operation

Detailed storage projections will be published after mainnet launch.

## Operations

### How often are hard forks expected?

No hard forks have occurred yet (network is pre-mainnet). The frequency of future hard forks is TBD, but all upgrades will be communicated via Twitter, Discord, and direct partner outreach.

All changes are deployed to testnet before mainnet.

### Does the node handle SIGTERM gracefully?

Yes, but given the TDX deployment, shutting down nodes is more complex than standard deployments. The node will exit cleanly with SIGTERM.

**Expected restart time**: About 1 minute from machine reboot.

### Have there been any major outages?

Not on mainnet (not yet launched). During testing, various issues have occurred, but these have been resolved prior to public release.

### Can I use third-party RPC providers?

Seismic is in active discussions with RPC providers but doesn't currently have public partnerships. Updates will be shared as partnerships are established.
