## Technical Custody Integration

### How does Seismic differ from standard EVM chains?

Seismic is approximately a **superset of the EVM**, meaning:
- Standard EVM functionality works identically to Ethereum
- Additional features enable shielded (private) computation
- Transaction construction and serialization identical to Ethereum (with one new transaction type)
- Address generation, gas estimation, and signing work the same as Ethereum

**Key differentiating features:**
- **Shielded state storage**: Solidity contracts can store private data on-chain
- **Encrypted calldata**: New transaction type (0x4a) encrypts transaction calldata
- **Privacy-preserving**: Uses Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environments), not zero-knowledge proofs

### Which existing EVM chain is Seismic most like?

Seismic is most like **Ethereum mainnet** with privacy enhancements. It uses:
- Same transaction types (Legacy 0x0 and EIP-1559 0x2) plus one new type (0x4a)
- Same gas model (EIP-1559 dynamic fees)
- Same serialization (RLP)
- Same address generation and cryptographic algorithms (Keccak-256, ECDSA secp256k1)
- Same account model (not UTXO-based)

### Have any RPC API methods been altered?

Yes, but only to protect shielded state:
- **`eth_getStorageAt`**: Will not reveal shielded storage slots
- **Call tracers**: Modified to prevent leaking shielded state in debug traces
- **`trace_filter`**: Some specific restrictions (TBD)

All other standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods work identically.

### Is transaction construction identical to Ethereum?

**Yes**, with one addition:
- **Legacy (0x0)** and **EIP-1559 (0x2)** transactions are 100% identical to Ethereum
- **Seismic transaction (0x4a)** is essentially a legacy transaction with encrypted calldata

Standard Ethereum transaction construction libraries will work without modification.

### Can gas be estimated using eth_estimateGas?

Yes, `eth_estimateGas` works exactly as on Ethereum.

### Are there other transaction types that could cause balance changes?

The Seismic transaction type (0x4a) can cause balance changes, but it functions similarly to a standard transaction - it just has encrypted calldata. There are no special transaction types like Arbitrum's Retryable Tickets.

### Do ERC-20 transfers emit the standard Transfer event?

**It depends on the token type:**

- **ERC20 tokens**: Yes, standard ERC20s emit the standard `Transfer` event (topic hash: `0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef`)
- **SRC20 tokens** (Seismic's shielded token standard): May not emit the standard Transfer event due to privacy features

**Important for custody providers**: SRC20 tokens are expected to dominate on Seismic. Balance tracking may require alternative methods beyond event indexing.

### Is the native asset transferred by setting the value field?

**Long-term**: Yes, native asset transfers work by setting the `value` field in transactions, identical to Ethereum.

**Short-term**: This is still being finalized for early mainnet. The native asset model may evolve in the first months post-launch.

### Do you support Anvil for local testing?

You must use **Sanvil**, Seismic's fork of Anvil. Standard Anvil does not support:
- Seismic transaction type (0x4a)
- Shielded storage opcodes (CLOAD/CSTORE)
- Encrypted calldata handling

Sanvil supports all standard Anvil operations including:
- Starting from a fork point or genesis file
- Sending native assets and ERC-20 tokens
- Contract deployment and testing
- Transaction tracing with `debug_traceTransaction`

### Are smart contracts verified on Sourcify or Etherscan?

Contract verification infrastructure is still being finalized. Details will be announced closer to mainnet launch.

### What is the expected throughput?

Seismic targets:
- **Block time**: 600ms - 1 second
- **Finality**: 1-2 blocks (< 2 seconds total)
- **Stress test results**: Sustained 1000+ QPS with P99 latency in seconds, P50 in tens of milliseconds

Exact throughput will depend on transaction complexity and network conditions.

### Are there deviations in address generation, gas estimation, or transaction signing?

**No deviations**. Seismic uses identical mechanisms to Ethereum:
- **Address generation**: Hash public key using Keccak-256, take last 20 bytes
- **Cryptographic algorithm**: ECDSA with secp256k1 curve
- **Serialization**: RLP (Recursive Length Prefix)
- **Hashing**: Keccak-256 (SHA-3 variant)
- **Replay protection**: EIP-155 chain ID-based nonce system
- **Transaction signing**: Standard Ethereum signing with chain ID 5123 (mainnet) or 5124 (testnet)

### Can a transaction be signed today and broadcast tomorrow?

Yes, there is no upper bound on the time between transaction construction and broadcast. Standard Ethereum nonce-based ordering applies.

### Does the protocol have gas?

Yes, Seismic uses the standard Ethereum gas model:
- Gas is estimated with `eth_estimateGas`
- Excess gas is refunded after execution
- Gas must be paid in the native Seismic token (cannot be paid in other currencies)
- EIP-1559 dynamic fees apply (base fee + priority fee)

### How are accounts created?

Accounts are **implicit** (same as Ethereum):
- Addresses exist as soon as you have a private key
- No on-chain instantiation required
- Accounts become "active" when they first receive a transaction or balance

### Does the blockchain have anonymity or privacy features?

Yes, but they are **opt-in**:
- Contracts can use shielded storage (CLOAD/CSTORE opcodes) for private state
- Users can send Seismic transactions (type 0x4a) with encrypted calldata
- Standard transactions remain fully transparent like Ethereum

Privacy is achieved through Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environments), not zero-knowledge proofs.

### Can balances change without a corresponding blockchain transaction?

**For standard ERC20/ERC721 tokens**: No, all balance changes require on-chain transactions.

**For SRC20 (shielded) tokens**: Balance changes are recorded on-chain, but may not be publicly visible in the same way as standard tokens due to privacy features.

### Can assets leave an address with no action from the sole key holder?

No, Seismic follows standard Ethereum security model - assets can only move with a valid signature from the private key holder (or via approved smart contract logic like allowances).

### Is it possible to query a blockchain node for deposits to an address?

Yes:
- Standard Ethereum methods (`eth_getLogs`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`) work identically
- Use RPC filters for event-based indexing
- Full archive nodes support querying from genesis

**Note**: Shielded (SRC20) token balances may require specialized queries depending on the token implementation.

### Is it possible to query the status of a broadcast transaction?

Yes, use standard Ethereum methods:
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt` for finalized transactions
- `eth_getTransactionByHash` for pending/confirmed transactions
- `eth_blockNumber` to check sync status

### How fast does storage for an RPC node grow?

- **Current size**: TBD (network launching soon)
- **Archive node**: 1TB+ storage recommended initially
- **Growth rate**: Will depend on network activity; approximately 12 hours of sync time expected for first year of operation

Detailed storage projections will be published after mainnet launch.

### How is throughput handled?

Seismic is a **monolithic L1 chain** (not sharded). Throughput is handled through:
- Fast block times (600ms - 1s)
- EIP-1559 dynamic gas pricing
- Efficient execution via Reth and seismic-reVM

### Is it possible to run a full node in local mode?

Yes, use **Sanvil** (Seismic's fork of Anvil) for local development and testing, similar to Bitcoin Regtest or Ethereum's Ganache.

### Are there any "gotcha's" to be aware of?

- **SRC20 tokens**: May not emit standard Transfer events; requires specialized indexing
- **Shielded storage**: `eth_getStorageAt` won't reveal private contract state
- **Intel TDX requirement**: Nodes require Intel TDX hardware; cannot run on standard VMs
- **Sanvil required**: Must use Sanvil instead of Anvil for local testing
- **Transaction type 0x4a**: Ensures encrypted calldata is handled correctly
- **Block timestamps**: Available in millisecond precision (though `block.timestamp` returns seconds for compatibility)
