# Introduction

## What is Seismic Network?

Seismic is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that introduces shielded (private) computation capabilities to Solidity smart contracts. It's built on a fork of [Reth](https://reth.rs/) (the Rust Ethereum client) and includes custom features for privacy-preserving transactions.

Seismic runs on Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environment), which enables secure, privacy-preserving computation while maintaining full EVM compatibility.

## Key Features

- **EVM-Compatible**: Deploy existing Solidity contracts without modification
- **Shielded Computation**: Private data storage and computation via new opcodes and precompiles
- **Fast Finality**: 1-2 blocks (< 2 seconds) to finality
- **High Performance**: Optimized for throughput with stress-tested performance under load
- **Secure Enclaves**: Runs on Intel TDX for trusted execution
