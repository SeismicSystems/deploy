# Development Tools

## Seismic Solidity

**[Seismic Solidity](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-solidity)** is Seismic's fork of the Solidity compiler that supports shielded types and privacy features.

:::info
Normal Solidity contracts will work on Seismic out-of-the-box. However, you will only be able to manage shielded state in contracts written with Seismic Solidity.
:::

To develop contracts that use Seismic's privacy features, you must use Seismic Solidity instead of standard Solidity.

For setup instructions and detailed documentation, see the [Seismic onboarding guide](https://docs.seismic.systems/onboarding/).

### Compiler Requirements

Contracts should be compiled with EVM version **'Paris' or later**. Existing compiled contracts work without modification.

## Seismic Forge (sforge)

**[Seismic Forge (sforge)](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-foundry)** is Seismic's fork of Foundry's Forge that integrates with Seismic Solidity and Sanvil. It provides a complete development environment for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Seismic.

For setup instructions and detailed documentation, see the [Seismic onboarding guide](https://docs.seismic.systems/onboarding/).

## Sanvil

**[Sanvil](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-foundry)** is Seismic's fork of Anvil (Foundry's local testnet node). To run local development and testing on Seismic, you must use Sanvil instead of the standard Anvil.

### Features

Sanvil supports:
- Starting from a fork point or genesis file
- Sending the native asset and ERC-20 tokens
- Creating and testing smart contracts
- Contract deployment and testing
- Transaction tracing with `debug_traceTransaction`
- Local development workflows (similar to Bitcoin Regtest or Ethereum's Ganache)

### Why Sanvil is Required

Standard Anvil does not support:
- Seismic transaction type (0x4a)
- Shielded storage opcodes (CLOAD/CSTORE)
- Encrypted calldata handling

:::warning
Standard Anvil is not compatible with Seismic's custom features (shielded state, transaction type 0x4a, etc.). You must use Sanvil for local testing.

## Seismic Compiler (ssolc)

`ssolc` is Seismic's Solidity compiler that includes support for shielded types and privacy features. It's part of the Seismic Solidity toolchain.

Installation instructions are available in the [Installation guide](/install).
