# Consensus

## Summit Consensus Client

[Summit](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/summit) is Seismic's consensus client that coordinates with the execution layer (Seismic Reth) and the enclave server.

Summit is built on [Commonware](https://commonware.xyz/), a modular framework for building blockchain infrastructure. Commonware provides the core building blocks that power Summit's consensus implementation.

## Simplex Consensus Algorithm

Seismic uses the Simplex consensus algorithm to achieve fast finality and high throughput.

### Finality

Seismic achieves finality in 1-2 blocks, with total finality time under 2 seconds. This is significantly faster than Ethereum mainnet.

**Finality details:**
- **Block time**: 600ms - 1 second
- **Blocks to finality**: 1-2 blocks
- **Total time to finality**: < 2 seconds

### Block Production

- **Block Rate**: 1 block per ~600ms - 1s
- **Empty Blocks**: Yes, like Ethereum, Seismic will produce empty blocks when there are no pending transactions

### Finality Tags

Currently, Seismic does not support the `"finalized"` block parameter tag as specified in EIP-3675. However, given the extremely fast finality (< 2 seconds), using `"latest"` provides near-equivalent guarantees.

**Workaround**: Use `"latest"` or specify a block number minus 1-2 blocks for finalized state.

This feature may be added in future updates if there's demand from integrators.

## Node Participation

### Publishing Transactions

Yes, if properly staked, nodes can propagate and publish transactions on-chain.

### Outages

Not on mainnet (not yet launched). During testing, various issues have occurred, but these have been resolved prior to public release.
