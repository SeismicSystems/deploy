# Architecture

## What Makes Seismic Unique

Seismic runs on Intel TDX (Trusted Execution Environment), which enables secure, privacy-preserving computation. This is more complex than standard node deployments:

- Nodes run in secure enclaves
- The deployment uses a VHD image with three integrated components
- Shutting down requires careful handling due to TDX constraints

## Required Binaries

Three binaries work together:

1. **[Seismic Reth](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-reth)** - Execution layer (fork of [Reth](https://reth.rs/))
2. **[Summit](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/summit)** - Consensus layer
3. **[Enclave](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/enclave)** - Privacy/shielded computation

All three binaries are deployed together in a VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) image built via Yocto.

### Additional Software

Node images also include:
- **SGX/TDX libraries** - Required for trusted execution environment
- **Supervisor** - Process management
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy for RPC endpoints
- **Certbot** - SSL certificate management
- **Rust toolchain** - For building and running Rust binaries

## Deployment Method

Nodes are deployed using a VHD image that contains all necessary binaries. Setup instructions and architecture documentation are available in the [deploy repository](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/deploy), which was open-sourced in October 2025.

## Hardware Requirements

### Intel TDX Requirement

Yes, Seismic nodes must run on **Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions)** for secure enclave execution. Internally, Azure has been used for deployments, and instructions for Azure deployment will be provided.

### Recommended Specifications

**Recommended specifications for Archive Nodes:**
- **CPU**: 4+ vCPUs (high-performance multi-core processor)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM
- **Network**: High-bandwidth, low-latency connection
- **OS Disk**: 256GB+ Premium SSD
- **Data Disk**: 1TB+ SSD storage for blockchain data
- **Required Hardware**: Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) support
- **Security Type**: Confidential virtual machines with secure boot and TPM enabled

:::info
All nodes currently run as archival nodes. Storage requirements will grow linearly with network usage.

**Example Azure Configuration (Devnet):**
- Size: Standard EC4es v5 (4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM)
- OS Disk: 256GB Premium SSD LRS
- Data Disks: 1x additional disk for blockchain data
- Security: Confidential VM with secure boot and TPM

**Benchmarked Performance:**
Detailed system requirements and benchmark results are available in the [deploy repository](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/deploy).

## Network Architecture

### Special Requirements

Yes - the node requires Intel TDX support and runs three interconnected components. Unlike simpler blockchain nodes, you cannot easily run individual pieces separately.

### Multiple Client Support

Currently, Seismic uses the Reth-based stack. Multiple client support may be added in the future.

## Configuration

### Data Directory

Yes, Reth supports specifying custom data directories, though the default is built into the VHD image.

### Host and Port

- **Host**: Yes, customizable
- **Port**: No (fixed in VHD image)

## Storage

### Storage Requirements

**Archive nodes**: 1TB+ recommended

Storage requirements will grow linearly with network activity. Within the first year, expect approximately 12 hours of sync time for full archive history.

### Monthly Growth

TBD - this depends on network activity and will be monitored after mainnet launch.

### Sync Time

- **From genesis**: Approximately 12 hours for the first year of mainnet operation (likely much less in the first 6 months)
- **With snapshots**: TBD - snapshot solution is still being developed
- **Startup time**: About 1 minute after a clean shutdown/reboot

### Snapshots

Snapshot support is planned and will be made available in the future. Once available, snapshots will significantly reduce initial sync times. Check the documentation and status page for updates on snapshot availability.

## Operations

### Graceful Shutdown

Yes, but given the TDX deployment, shutting down nodes is more complex than standard deployments. The node will exit cleanly with SIGTERM.

**Expected restart time**: About 1 minute from machine reboot.

### Hard Forks

No hard forks have occurred yet (network is pre-mainnet). The frequency of future hard forks is TBD, but all upgrades will be communicated via Twitter, Discord, and direct partner outreach.

All changes are deployed to testnet before mainnet.

## Seismic REVM

The Seismic REVM is a modified version of the Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine (REVM) that supports shielded computation and the custom opcodes. More details: https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-revm

## Performance

### Scalability

Seismic has been extensively stress-tested under high load. Performance targets:
- **P99 latency**: On the order of seconds under high load (1000+ QPS)
- **P50 latency**: Tens of milliseconds

Benchmarks will be made public soon.

### Is Seismic a ZK Chain?

No. Seismic uses trusted execution environments (TEE) via Intel TDX for privacy, not zero-knowledge proofs.

## Shielded Features

Seismic supports:
- **Shielded storage**: Data stored privately on-chain via `CLOAD`/`CSTORE` opcodes
- **Encrypted calldata**: Transaction type 0x4a encrypts calldata
- **Shielded types in Solidity**: New data types for private state
