# Installation

:::info
We currently support devices with x86_64/arm64 architectures running MacOS, Ubuntu or Windows.

The local development suite uses `sforge` as the testing framework, `sanvil` as the local node, and `ssolc` as the compiler.

## sforge, sanvil, and ssolc

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) / [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) / [brew](https://brew.sh/) / [jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) on your machine if you don't already have them. Default installations for all work well.

```bash
# install rust and cargo
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### 2. Download sfoundryup

Download and execute the sfoundryup installation script.

```bash
curl -L \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/SeismicSystems/seismic-foundry/contents/sfoundryup/install?ref=seismic" | bash
source ~/.zshenv  # or ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Install Development Tools

Install `sforge`, `sanvil`, `ssolc`. Expect this to take between 5-20 minutes depending on your machine.

```bash
sfoundryup
source ~/.zshenv  # or ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### 4. Clean Existing Projects

Remove old build artifacts in existing projects.

```bash
sforge clean  # run in your project's contract directory
```

## VSCode Extension

We also recommend adding syntax highlighting via the [`seismic`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SeismicSys.seismic) extension from the VSCode marketplace. If you have the `solidity` extension, you'll have to disable it while writing Seismic code.
